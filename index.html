            <p>Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books
                published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan
                Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology 
                comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age
                of Comic Books. He has been featured in comic books,
                television shows, films, video games, novels, and plays.</p>
        <p>Spider-Man's secret identity is Peter Benjamin Parker.
          Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage high-school
          student and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben
          in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker
          died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal
          with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and
         gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson,
         J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen
         Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies
         such as the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom. In 
         his origin story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman web-swinging 
         spider-powers and abilities after being bitten by aweb-swinging 
         radioactive spider. These powers include web-swinging man 
         strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability,
         coordination, and balance; clinging to surfaces and webswinging 
         ceilings like a spider; and detecting danger with his
         precognition ability called "spider-sense"   Spider-Man.</p>
      <p>When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in 
        superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of 
         to the protagonist. The Spider-Man comic series broke ground by
        featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New
        York, as Spider-Man's secret identity, whose "self-obsessions
         with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to
         which young readers could relate.[8] While Spider-Man was a 
         quintessential sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes Bucky 
         Barnes and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like 
         Captain America and Batman; he had learned the lesson for 
         himself that "with great power comes great responsibility"—a 
         line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man's origin story,
         but later retroactively attributed to the late Uncle Ben
          Parker.

These powers include superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance; clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability called "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for fighting and for web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker originally used his powers for his own personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that Peter could not stop, he began to use his powers to fight crime by becoming Spider-Man.
